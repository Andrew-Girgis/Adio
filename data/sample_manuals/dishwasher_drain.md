# Dishwasher Drain Troubleshooting

Use this procedure when the dishwasher finishes a cycle but leaves water at the bottom.

## Procedure: Dishwasher Not Draining
1. Turn off power at the breaker before opening the kick plate. [safety: Disconnect power to prevent electric shock while inspecting components.] [explain: The drain circuit and pump are energized during cycles.]
2. Remove and clean the filter basket and sump area. [explain: Debris in the filter is the most common drain failure in residential dishwashers.]
3. Check the drain hose for kinks and clogs, including the high-loop near the sink. [explain: Kinks reduce flow and can force dirty water back into the tub.]
4. Inspect the garbage disposal knock-out plug if recently installed. [explain: A sealed disposal inlet blocks dishwasher drainage entirely.]
5. Run a short rinse cycle and confirm water exits to the sink drain. [confirm: required] [explain: This validates that flow is restored before reassembly.]
6. Reinstall panels and restore power only after confirming no leaks. [safety: Do not restore power with exposed wiring or visible water.] [explain: Final reassembly prevents accidental contact with moving or live parts.]

## Procedure: Dishwasher Humming But Not Draining
1. Turn off power and water supply before accessing the pump area. [safety: Electrical and slip hazards increase when standing water is present.]
2. Remove standing water with a cup to expose the sump and impeller region. [explain: Clearing water lets you detect obstructions quickly.]
3. Check for glass, food labels, or seeds around the impeller inlet. [explain: Small objects can jam the impeller and cause motor hum without pumping.]
4. Reassemble and run a drain cycle while listening for smooth pump sound. [confirm: required]
