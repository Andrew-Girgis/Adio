# Basic Car No-Start (Battery / Terminals)
Tags: car, battery, no start, terminals, jump start

Use this basic procedure for vehicles that click once or crank slowly.

## Procedure: Car Clicks But Won't Start
1. Shift to park, set parking brake, and turn ignition fully off. [safety: Keep the vehicle from rolling and prevent accidental starter engagement.] [explain: Stabilizing the vehicle is mandatory before touching battery hardware.]
2. Inspect battery terminals for corrosion or loose clamps. [explain: Poor contact causes voltage drop under starter load.]
3. Clean corrosion with battery-safe cleaner and tighten clamps hand-snug plus quarter turn. [safety: Wear eye protection and avoid touching both terminals simultaneously.]
4. Attempt start; if still slow, test battery voltage or use a jump pack. [explain: Low open-circuit voltage indicates battery charge health issues.]
5. After successful start, confirm alternator charging warning light is off. [confirm: required] [explain: A charging fault means the battery may fail again soon.]

## Procedure: Safe Jump Start Checklist
1. Confirm both vehicles are off and jumper cables are undamaged. [safety: Damaged insulation can cause short circuits or sparks.]
2. Connect red to dead battery positive, then red to donor positive. [explain: Positive path is established first to reduce accidental chassis contact.]
3. Connect black to donor negative, then black to grounded metal on dead car. [safety: Final connection away from battery reduces ignition risk from hydrogen gas.]
4. Start donor car, wait 60 seconds, then start dead car. [confirm: required]
5. Remove cables in reverse order and keep clamps from touching. [safety: Contact between clamps can arc and damage electronics.]
