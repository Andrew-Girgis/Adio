# Washer Does Not Spin
Tags: washer, spin cycle, laundry, belt, lid switch

## Procedure: Washer Not Spinning
1. Unplug washer before opening rear or lower access panel. [safety: Unplugging prevents shock when inspecting motor or switch wiring.]
2. Check load balance and remove heavy wet items causing imbalance shutdown. [explain: Many washers halt spin if tub vibration exceeds threshold.]
3. Inspect lid switch actuator for damage or misalignment. [explain: A failed lid switch prevents spin for user safety.]
4. Inspect belt condition and tension if your model uses a belt drive. [explain: A loose or cracked belt slips under load and prevents full spin speed.]
5. Run spin-only cycle and confirm drum reaches speed without abnormal noise. [confirm: required]
